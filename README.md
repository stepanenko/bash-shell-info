# Bash / Shell Notes

`SSH` - secure shell  
`~` - home directory  
`$` - logged in as a standard user  

Bash scripts start with a shebang (`#!`) followed by a path to the application that should run it. E.g.: `#!/bin/zsh`

`echo` - prints the following message. E.g.: `echo "My first bash script"`

`which $SHELL` - prints currently used shell
